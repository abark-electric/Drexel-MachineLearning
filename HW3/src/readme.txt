CS383 - Assignment3 - ReadMe
By Haolin Hong

There are 2 parts in assignment which need write Matlab script.
For part 2, script named ClosedFormLinearRegression.m;
For part 3, script named SFoldsCrossValidation.m.

To run the script, please open Matlab, switch to the folder contain both .m file and x06Simple.csv file. Then, type the script name in command window.

If it is not the first time running this script and you have x06Simple.mat file in the same folder, it will load the .mat file automatically instead of loading from .csv file.
Thus, please make sure you do not have other file named diabetes.mat in the running folder (it may cause an error).

Both two script will run and print out the data we needed for this assignment and load the original environment variable back.

All scripts has been tested. It suppose to work very well.
Thus, if there are any bug or error occurs, please email me.
